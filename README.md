# Sgaglione and McCall 2024, Final Research Project for Env 617, Understanding the Relationship Between Urban Trees, Climate Risk, and Socio-Economic Indicators in Amsterdam

# Introduction #
Hallo en welkom! Hello and welcome to our Final Project for ENV 617!

The research question we seek to answer is: what is the relationship between urban trees in Amsterdam and socio-economic indicators, such as house price, and climate risk, such as flood risk?

These are important questions to explore as the effects of a globally changing climate are threatening lives and livelihoods around the world. One solution to mitigate the effects of climate change is increasing the overall urban tree canopy coverage. Urban trees are an invaluable resource to urban areas because of the range of benefits and ecosystem services they support, such as: cooling streets, filtering air pollution, managing stormwater, reducing flooding, protecting biodiversity, providing areas for shade, and increasing social cohesion.

In Amsterdam, Netherlands, there is existing literature on the distribution of tree canopy and housing prices. Amsterdam is a highly dense and compact city, leaving little space for street trees compared to the exurban areas and other Dutch cities. Between 2009 and 2016, the average percentage tree cover in Amsterdam decreased from 12.5 percent to 10.5 percent (Bouwknegt, et al., 2023). Following the release of this data, the municipality of Amsterdam began dedicating efforts to increase and restore trees across the city, including the declared maintenance of over 300,000 trees. Luckily, the city records and tracks all 300,000 trees in a public, online database, https://maps.amsterdam.nl/open_geodata/, which is the data source for this project. By better understanding the relationship of city-maintained trees and various socio-economic and climate-related indicators, the city of Amsterdam can have a clearer insight into the their tree management practices.

The goals of this research is to encourage other cities of similar size, density, and climate to develop urban tree managemnet programs with the goal of mitigating the effects of climate change through local, ecology-focused efforts.
